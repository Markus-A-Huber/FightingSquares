# Fighting Squares Binaries#

Here you can find windows executables of the game which allow you to play the game without compiling the sourcecode yourself.
The game is written in C# and based on .NET version 4.5.2 which is also the version you need installed to play the game on your computer (or higher). For instructions and caveats please read the README.md in the root directory of this repository. I check each executable prior to upload with an updated Anti-Virus-Scanner. This means if your Anti-Virus-Scanner shows an alert, the file might be corrupted. I advise not to execute it in this case.

## Versions ##

## License ##
The game is licensed under the BSD 3-clause license. For a text version see LICENSE.md in the root directory.
